## Number Systems

  Humans started counting with base 10 most likely because we had 10 fingers, However because bits only have 2 states computers use base 2 numbers.

  Octal and Hex are also more compatible with computers because they can convert one digit directly to a certain number of bits.

  Octal: one digit can go as high as 7 and in binary 7 is the limit of 3 digits or 3 bits $111 \rightarrow 7$

  Hex: one digit can go as high as 15 and 15 is the limit of 4 bits $1111 \rightarrow 15$

  Decimal: one digit can go as high as 9 but 9 in binary is 1001 so we would need to add another decimal digit to track 4 binary digits and if we traced 3 binary digits we would have extra decimal numbers left over.


  ## Binary system

  Altair, like other computers, uses binary calculations.

  Each number is a byte or 8 bits.

  to convert from binary to decimal you multiply each digit by 2 raised to the column that it is in starting with 0 from the right and add them all.

  $1101 \rightarrow 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 13$
