## Number Systems

  Humans started counting with base 10 most likely becuase we had 10 fingers, However becusae bits only have 2 states computers use base 2 numbers.

  Octal and Hex are also more compatible with compters because they can convert one digit directly to a cirten number of bits.

  Octal: one digit can go as high as 7 and in binary 7 is the limit of 3 digits or 3 bits $111 \rightarrow 7$

  Hex: one digit can go as high as 15 and 15 is the limit of 4 bits $1111 \rightarrow 15$

  Decimal: one digit can go as high as 9 but 9 in binary is 1001 so we would need to add another decimal digit to track 4 binary digits and if we traced 3 binary digits we would have extra decimal numbers left over.
