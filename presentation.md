## Number Systems

  Humans started counting with base 10 most likely becuase we had 10 fingers, However becusae bits only have 2 states computers use base 2 numbers.

  Octal and Hex are also more compatible with compters because they can convert one digit directly to a cirten number of bits.

  Octal: one digit can go as high as 7 and in binary 7 is the limit of 3 digits or 3 bits $111 \leftarrow 7$
