* the 3 basic logic functions can be made with simple circuts
* semi circle is and
* pointy semi circl is or
* triangle with circle on the right is not
* combining not with the other 2 make 2 more logic circuts NAND and NOR
* these are shown with the symbol of either and or or but they have a circle on the right side like how the origional not does
* 3 or more logic circuts make a logic system
* one basic logic system is a exculsice or (xor)
* the xor it only activates when one and only one is true
* this can be used for addidton when it has a carry becuase if one and only one of the imputs is true it should return a 1
* this can be repersented as a or with a extra line on the left and the carry is generly ignored
