## intro

* the altair was one of the cheapest options on the market and easiest to get at home
* it had an entire CPU on a single chip
* The manual can teach both new and experienced people

## Logic

* George Boole Published a book called The Mathematical Analysis of Logic which was the foundation for most of the electronic logic we use today
* Boole assumed logical statements can be either true or false
* this allowed us to make a logic statement for or and and not
* and is only on if both inputs are true
* or is true if at least one is true
* not reverses the input
* logic tables show all outputs of a logic expression

## Electronic Logic

* the 3 basic logic functions can be made with simple circuits
* semi circle is and
* pointy semi circle is or
* triangle with circle on the right is not
* combining not with the other 2 make 2 more logic circuits NAND and NOR
* these are shown with the symbol of either and or or but they have a circle on the right side like how the original not does
* 3 or more logic circuits make a logic system
* one basic logic system is an exclusive or (xor)
* the xor it only activates when one and only one is true
* this can be used for addition when it has a carry because if one and only one of the inputs is true it should return a 1
* this can be represented as a or with an extra line on the left and the carry is generally ignored

## number systems

* humans started with a base 10 system probably because we have 10 fingers
* however using a base 2 system can be more advantageous with computers
* we can also use hex or octal to read binary in a quicker manner

## Binary system

* The altair uses binary calculations
* one number contains 8 bits
* A byte is 8 bits
* Binary uses 0 and 1 and is base 2
* to convert from binary to decimal you can multiply each digit by 2^(column of the number starting from the right at 0) then adding them all together
